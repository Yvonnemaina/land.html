          <h2 style="color:blue;">1.Mt Kenya</h2>
          <img src="mt kenya.jpg" width="669" height="446" class="float-img"/>
          <p>Mount Kenya is the highest mountain in Kenya and the second-highest in Africa, after Kilimanjaro.[4] The highest peaks of the mountain are Batian (5,199 metres or 17,057 feet), Nelion (5,188 m or 17,021 ft) and Point Lenana (4,985 m or 16,355 ft). Mount Kenya is located in the former Eastern and Central provinces of Kenya; its peak is now the intersection of Meru, Embu, Laikipia, Kirinyaga, Nyeri and Tharaka Nithi counties, about 9 kilometres (5+5⁄8 miles) south of the equator, around 150 km (90 mi) north-northeast of the capital Nairobi.[4] Mount Kenya is the source of the name of the Republic of Kenya.

            Mount Kenya is a volcano created approximately 3 million years after the opening of the East African Rift.[5] Before glaciation, it was 7,000 m (23,000 ft) high. It was covered by an ice cap for thousands of years. This has resulted in very eroded slopes and numerous valleys radiating from the peak.[6][7] There are currently 11 small glaciers, which are shrinking rapidly, and may disappear by 2050.[8] The forested slopes are an important source of water for much of Kenya.[9]
            
            There are several vegetation bands from the base to the peak.[10] The lower slopes are covered by different types of forest. Many alpine species are endemic to Mount Kenya, such as the giant lobelias and senecios and a local subspecies of rock hyrax.[11] An area of 715 km2 (276 sq mi) around the centre of the mountain was designated a National Park and listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997.[12] The park receives over 16,000 visitors per year.[13][9]</p>
